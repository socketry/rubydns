RubyDNS is a high-performance DNS server which can be easily integrated into other projects or used as a stand-alone daemon. By default it uses rule-based pattern matching. Results can be hard-coded, computed, fetched from a remote DNS server or fetched from a local cache, depending on requirements.

[![RubyDNS Introduction](http://img.youtube.com/vi/B9ygq0xh3HQ/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9ygq0xh3HQ&feature=youtu.be&hd=1 "RubyDNS Introduction")

In addition, RubyDNS includes a high-performance asynchronous DNS resolver built on top of [Celluloid][1]. This module can be used by itself in client applications without using the full RubyDNS server stack.

For examples and documentation please see the main [project page][2].

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

	gem 'rubydns'

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install rubydns

## Usage

This is copied from `test/examples/test-dns-2.rb`. It has been simplified slightly.

	#!/usr/bin/env ruby
	require 'rubydns'

	INTERFACES = [
		[:udp, "0.0.0.0", 5300],
		[:tcp, "0.0.0.0", 5300]
	]

	# Use upstream DNS for name resolution.
	UPSTREAM = RubyDNS::Resolver.new([[:udp, "8.8.8.8", 53], [:tcp, "8.8.8.8", 53]])

	# Start the RubyDNS server
	RubyDNS::run_server(:listen => INTERFACES) do
		match(/test\.mydomain\.org/, IN::A) do |transaction|
			transaction.respond!("10.0.0.80")
		end

		# Default DNS handler
		otherwise do |transaction|
			transaction.passthrough!(UPSTREAM)
		end
	end

Start the server using `./test.rb`. You can then test it using dig:

	$ dig @localhost -p 5300 test.mydomain.org
	$ dig @localhost -p 5300 google.com

### File Handle Limitations

On some platforms (e.g. Mac OS X) the number of file descriptors is relatively low by default and should be increased by calling `ulimit -n 10000` before running tests or even before starting a server which expects a large number of concurrent incoming connections.

### Custom servers

It is possible to create and integrate your own custom servers.

	class MyServer < RubyDNS::Server
		def process(name, resource_class, transaction)
			transaction.fail!(:NXDomain)
		end
	end
	
	# Use the RubyDNS infrastructure for running the daemon:
	# If asynchronous is true, it will return immediately, otherwise, it will block the current thread until Ctrl-C is pressed (SIGINT).
	RubyDNS::run_server(asynchronous: false, server_class: MyServer)
	
	# Directly instantiate the celluloid supervisor:
	supervisor = MyServer.supervise
	supervisor.actors.first.run

This is the best way to integrate with other projects.

## Performance

We welcome additional benchmarks and feedback regarding RubyDNS performance. To check the current performance results, consult the [travis build job output](https://travis-ci.org/ioquatix/rubydns).

### Server

The performance is on the same magnitude as `bind9`. Some basic benchmarks resolving 1000 names concurrently, repeated 5 times, using `RubyDNS::Resolver` gives the following:

	                           user     system      total        real
	RubyDNS::Server        4.280000   0.450000   4.730000 (  4.854862)
	Bind9                  4.970000   0.520000   5.490000 (  5.541213)

These benchmarks are included in the unit tests. To test bind9 performance, it must be installed and `which named` must return the executable.

### Resolver

The `RubyDNS::Resolver` is highly concurrent and can resolve individual names as fast as the built in `Resolv::DNS` resolver. Because the resolver is asynchronous, when dealing with multiple names, it can work more efficiently:

	                           user     system      total        real
	RubyDNS::Resolver      0.020000   0.010000   0.030000 (  0.030507)
	Resolv::DNS            0.070000   0.010000   0.080000 (  1.465975)

These benchmarks are included in the unit tests.

### DNSSEC support

DNSSEC is currently not supported and is [unlikely to be supported in the future](http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/01/15/against-dnssec/).

## Examples

### How to respond with something other than what was requested

	# Full code in examples/cname.rb
	
	RubyDNS::run_server do
		# Match request for IN A resource records...
		match(//, IN::A) do |transaction|
			# And return an IN CNAME record:
			transaction.respond!(Name.create('foo.bar'), resource_class: IN::CNAME)
		end
	end

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

### Desired Features

* Support for more features of DNS such as zone transfer.
* Support reverse records more easily.
* Some kind of system level integration, e.g. registering a DNS server with the currently running system resolver.
