# A sample DNS daemon that demonstrates how to use RubyDNS to build responses
# that vary based on the geolocation of the requesting peer.  Clients of
# this server who request A records will get an answer IP address based
# on the continent of the client IP address.
#
# Please note that use of this example requires that the peer have a public
# IP address.  IP addresses on private networks or the localhost IP (127.0.0.1)
# cannot be resolved to a location, and so will always yield the unknown result.
# This daemon requires the file downloaded from
# http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz
# For more information, please see http://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite and
# http://geoip.rubyforge.org
