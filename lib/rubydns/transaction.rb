		# - `:NoError`: No error occurred.
		# - `:FormErr`: The incoming data was not formatted correctly.
		# - `:ServFail`: The operation caused a server failure (internal error, etc).
		# - `:NXDomain`: Non-eXistant Domain (domain record does not exist).
		# - `:NotImp`: The operation requested is not implemented.
		# - `:Refused`: The operation was refused by the server.
		# - `:NotAuth`: The server is not authoritive for the zone.
		#
		# See [RFC2929](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2929.txt) for more information about DNS error codes (specifically, page 3).
