# RubyDNS

RubyDNS is a high-performance DNS server which can be easily integrated into other projects or used as a stand-alone daemon. By default it uses rule-based pattern matching. Results can be hard-coded, computed, fetched from a remote DNS server or fetched from a local cache, depending on requirements.
